evTools INSTALL


You can use CMake to configure and compile the code.  CMake is open-source
software, and can be downloaded from http://www.cmake.org/.


To compile and install the code (in the default directories; /usr/...;
the binary executables will be installed in the bin/ subdirectory), from the 
main package directory (the one that contains the file CMakeLists.txt), do:

 $ mkdir build && cd build/
 $ cmake ..
 $ make
 $ sudo make install


To install the code in a specific directory, e.g. /home/me/usr/, 
   replace the "cmake .." step above with:

 $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/home/me/usr ..


If you're installing the code somewhere in your home directory, you can leave out
   the sudo command in the last step:

 $ make install


To force CMake to compile the code with your favourite compiler, prepend the cmake line 
   with e.g. FC=gfortran:

 $ FC=gfortran cmake ..


To compile the code without installing it anywhere, leave out the last step
   ((sudo) make install)




In order to compute colours from Teff, L, Z and g, you need to put the files 
   UBVRI.Kur and UBVRI.LBC in the directory ~/usr/lib/ (where ~ is your home directory).
   You can obtain these files from:

   UBVRI.Kur               table of synthetic BC and UBVRI colours, from Kurucz 
                           model atmospheres (1992, IAU Symp 149, p.225)
			   
   UBVRI.LBC               empirically corrected version of the above, from
                           Lejeune, Cuisinier & Buser (1997, A&AS 125, 229)
