evTools README


The evTools package provides tools to manipulate and display output from the binary 
stellar-evolution code ev (also known as STARS and TWIN).  The plotting programmes
need PGPlot (available from http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~tjp/pgplot/), for compilation
you can use CMake (available at http://www.cmake.org/).  To download the evTools 
package, read the code documentation, or to contact the developers, see:
